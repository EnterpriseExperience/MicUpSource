## UPDATE <-> [v1.1]:
## Hopefully fixed Anti Stand Stealer + Some Bugs (Still working on Celery, but should work kinda fine)
## TODO: Fix functions with Synapse Z version (when i purchase Synapse Z again) + Add a auto stealer that automatically steals a stand and unclaims it without interruptions by characters, objects, etc (collision stupid shit)
