## 🔥 FLAMES HUB NEW API! 🔥 ##
```lua
-- Usage:

local flames_api = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnterpriseExperience/MicUpSource/refs/heads/main/Flame_Hubs_API.lua"))()

-- Flames API arguments:
-- flames_api.FindPlayer("random") -- example of 'FindPlayer', supports: shortening names, displaynames, and usernames. (does not let you target yourself, will be fixed soon, had some issues with that part).
-- flames_api.ExecutorName -- will let you display the executor's current name (just name, not version), works for TextLabels and stuff to, automatically defaults to "Unknown" if somehow not supported or not found, and is automatically a tostring.
-- flames_api.Service("Service_Name") -- Service getter, will obviously check if the service even exists before getting it, but will default to "cloneref" sandboxing the service if supported, if not somehow, it'll default to regular service fetcher.
-- flames_api.LocalPlayer -- Should be obvious what this does, get's your LocalPlayer.
-- flames_api.RandomString(string) -- when inputting a string it'll randomize it for you automatically.
-- flames_api.Character -- returns your Character, doesn't matter if you respawn, or what not, it'll always automatically update it.
-- flames_api.HumanoidRootPart -- grabs your HumanoidRootPart (even if you die, respawn, etc).
-- flames_api.Humanoid -- grabs your Humanoid (even if you die, respawn, etc).
-- flames_api.Head -- grabs your Head (even if you die, respawn, etc).
-- flames_api.SeatPart -- grabs your current SeatPart.
-- flames_api.Vehicle -- uses "SeatPart" to get your Vehicle, and checks the Vehicle to see if it has wheels, and if it's a Model as well.
-- flames_api.GoTo -- usage: flames_api.GoTo("Player") and it will attempt to Pivot your Character to they're Character if the target name is correct and exists.
-- flames_api.WalkSpeed -- Allows you to set your WalkSpeed in this API.
-- flames_api.JumpPower -- Allows you to set your JumpHeight/JumpPower in this API, has detection for JumpHeight AND JumpPower, so if your game uses JumpPower, it'll know, and if JumpHeight, it'll know.
-- flames_api.BypassWalkSpeed -- Will attempt to use 'getconnections', if supported, to bypass WalkSpeed checks from games (this method only works if the game detects using "GetPropertyChangedSignal")
-- flames_api.BypassJumpPower -- Will attempt to use 'getconnections', if supported, to bypass JumpHeight/JumPower checks from games (this method only works if the game detects using "GetPropertyChangedSignal")
```
